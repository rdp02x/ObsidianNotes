- **Authentication**:
	- Confirms the identities of both the sender and the receiver.
	- Verifies the origin and destination of the information.
### Types of Cryptography:
In general there are three Types of Cryptography:
#### Symmetric Key Cryptography
- **Definition**: Symmetric key cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption of messages.
- **Encryption**: The sender uses the shared key to encrypt the plain text into cipher text.
- **Decryption**: The receiver uses the same key to decrypt the cipher text back into plain text.
- **Advantages**:
	- **Speed**: Symmetric key algorithms are generally faster and require less computational power compared to asymmetric algorithms.
	- **Simplicity**: The encryption and decryption processes are straightforward.
- **Challenges**:
	- **Key Distribution**: Securely exchanging the key between the sender and receiver can be difficult. If the key is intercepted during transmission, the security of the entire communication is compromised.
- **Popular Algorithms**:
	- **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**: An older symmetric key algorithm that is now considered insecure due to its short key length.
	- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A widely used and secure symmetric key algorithm that supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
#### Hash Functions
- **Definition**: Hash functions generate a fixed-length hash value from input data, without using a key. This value uniquely represents the input data.
- **Process**:
	- **Hash Calculation**: The plain text data is processed by the hash function to produce a hash value (digest).
	- **Irreversibility**: It is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and retrieve the original data from the hash value.

## Steganography

- **Definition**:
  - **Etymology**: Derived from the Greek words “stegos” (meaning “to cover”) and “grayfia” (meaning “writing”), translating to “covered writing” or “hidden writing.”
  - **Description**: Steganography is the practice of hiding secret data within another file, such as audio, video, image, or text, to prevent detection and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Data Hiding**: Conceals the existence of the secret information by embedding it in a seemingly innocuous file.
  - **Security**: Adds an additional layer of security by making the hidden data less detectable compared to other methods like encryption alone.
- **Methods**:
  - **Image Steganography**: Embeds secret data within the pixels of an image file. Minor changes to pixel values are often imperceptible to the human eye.
  - **Audio Steganography**: Hides data within audio files by modifying certain frequencies or introducing small, inaudible changes.
  - **Video Steganography**: Embeds information within video files by altering frames or embedding data in audio tracks.
  - **Text Steganography**: Conceals data within text files by using techniques such as altering word spacing, punctuation, or inserting extra characters.
- **Applications**:
  - **Data Protection**: Used to safeguard sensitive information by concealing it in files that appear harmless.
  - **Covert Communication**: Allows for secret communication without drawing attention to the fact that data is being transmitted.
### Types of Steganography
Steganography basically includes 5 types: 
#### Text Steganography:
- **Definition**: Text steganography involves embedding a secret message within a text file in such a way that the message is not obvious to the casual reader.
- **Techniques**:
- **First Letter Method**: Hides a message by using the initial letters of each sentence or paragraph to spell out the hidden text.
- **Meaningful Typos**: Incorporates deliberate spelling mistakes or unusual word choices that have a concealed meaning.
- **Punctuation Encoding**: Uses specific patterns or types of punctuation to encode information in a way that is not immediately noticeable.

- **Application**: Ideal for hiding messages within normal text documents or communications.
#### Image Steganography:
- **Definition**: Image steganography embeds secret data within a digital image file. The embedded data is hidden in such a way that the changes are not visible to the naked eye.
- **Techniques**:
- **Least Significant Bits (LSB)**: Conceals data in the least significant bits of the color values of image pixels. Changes made this way are minimal and generally imperceptible.
- **Image Substitution**: Embeds one image within another by adjusting pixel values so that the hidden image is not detectable.
- **Application**: Often used for watermarking or transmitting secret images without altering the visible content.
#### Video Steganography:
- **Definition**: Video steganography hides information within a video file, leveraging the fact that videos are composed of a sequence of images (frames).
- **Techniques**:

- **Frame Embedding**: Inserts hidden data into individual frames of the video. Since each frame is an image, data can be embedded similarly to image steganography.

- **Temporal Coding**: Alters specific frames or sequences within the video to embed data, utilizing changes over time to hide information.
- **Application**: Suitable for embedding large amounts of data or hiding entire video files within other videos, often used for covert data transmission.
#### Audio Steganography:
- **Definition**: Audio steganography hides secret data within audio files. This can involve modifying the audio in ways that are not perceptible to listeners.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Backmasking**: Embeds messages that can only be discerned when the audio is played in reverse, requiring the listener to use special playback techniques.
  - **Least Significant Bits (LSB)**: Similar to image steganography, this technique modifies the least significant bits of audio samples to encode hidden data.
- **Application**: Useful for embedding information within sound recordings or music tracks, often for covert communication.
#### Network Steganography:
- **Definition**: Network steganography involves concealing information within network traffic, such as data packets, in order to evade detection and protect data during transmission.

## One-Way Functions

#### Definition
- **One-Way Function**: A one-way function is a type of mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse. Given an input, the function produces an output quickly, but deriving the original input from the output is computationally infeasible.
#### Key Properties
- **Easy to Compute** - Given an input, the output is straightforward to calculate. For example, multiplying two prime numbers is a simple process.
- **Hard to Reverse** - Determining the original input from the output is difficult. For instance, if you are given a large number resulting from the multiplication of two primes, finding those primes is challenging.
- **Unique Outputs** - Each distinct input generates a unique output. This ensures that different inputs will produce different results, similar to how different recipes create different-tasting cookies.
### Why Use One-Way Functions in Cryptography?
One-way functions are fundamental to online security, providing several crucial benefits:
#### Hash Functions:
- **Description**: In cryptography, one-way functions are used as hash functions. When you input your password on a website, it is hashed into a unique string of characters. This hashed value is stored, not the actual password, making it nearly impossible for an attacker to reverse-engineer your password from the hash.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords, is protected even if the hash is exposed.
#### Digital Signatures:
- **Description**: One-way functions are used to create digital signatures. When you sign a document digitally, the data is processed through a one-way function to generate a unique signature. This signature verifies the document’s authenticity and ensures that it has not been tampered with.
- **Purpose**: Provides a way to authenticate documents and confirm their integrity, similar to a handwritten signature but with higher security.
#### Public-Key Cryptography:
- **Description**: In public-key cryptography, one-way functions are used to generate key pairs. The public key is derived from the private key using a one-way function. The public key can be shared openly, while the private key remains confidential. The system relies on the fact that deriving the private key from the public key is computationally infeasible.
- **Purpose**: Secures communications and transactions by ensuring that even if the public key is known, the private key cannot be easily deduced.
### Examples of One-Way Functions
#### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit):
- **Description**: SHA-256 is a widely used hash function that produces a unique 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is a fundamental component in blockchain technologies like Bitcoin, where it ensures the integrity of data by providing a unique fingerprint for each input.
- **Application**: Used for verifying data integrity and in various cryptographic protocols.
#### MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):
- **Description**: MD5 generates a 128-bit hash value and was widely used for data integrity checks. However, due to discovered vulnerabilities, it is no longer recommended for cryptographic security.
- **Application**: Historically used for checksums and data integrity verification.
####  SA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
- **Description**: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. Although not a hash function, RSA uses one-way functions for secure data transmission. Multiplying large numbers is easy, but factoring the product into its original primes is extremely hard.
- **Application**: Used for secure data encryption and digital signatures.

## Introduction to Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and security of digital communications or documents. It functions as a virtual equivalent to handwritten signatures and is crucial for maintaining trust in digital interactions.
### Key Aspects of Digital Signatures
- **Authenticity** - A valid digital signature provides assurance to the recipient that the message or document was created and sent by a verified sender. It helps in verifying the origin of the communication.
- **Integrity** - Digital signatures ensure that the content of a message or document remains unaltered during transmission. If any changes are made to the content after signing, the signature will be invalidated.
- **Security** - Digital signatures utilize cryptographic techniques, such as hashing and public-key encryption, to secure the data. They are based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which includes digital certificates to verify identities and secure communications.
- **Legal Significance** - In many jurisdictions, including the United States, digital signatures have the same legal weight as traditional handwritten signatures. They can be used to create legally binding agreements and documents.
### Types of Digital Signatures
Digital signatures come in various types, each with different levels of security and application. Here are the three main types:
#### Simple Digital Signature
- **Description**: This is the most basic form of digital signature, often not protected by encryption. It can be as simple as an electronic version of a handwritten signature or an email signature.
- **Security**: Provides minimal security; mainly serves as a basic method of signing documents electronically.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for non-sensitive communications or informal agreements.
#### Advanced Digital Signature:
- **Description**: An advanced digital signature is more secure than a simple digital signature. It is linked to the signer's identity through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) standards, which involve digital certificates.
- **Security**: Offers a higher level of security by ensuring that the signature is uniquely associated with the signer and that the document has not been altered.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in secure communications, online transactions, and where a higher level of assurance is required.
#### Qualified Digital Signature:
- **Description**: The most secure type of digital signature, requiring a rigorous level of identity verification through digital certificates. It is legally recognized in many countries as having the same validity as a handwritten signature.
- **Security**: Provides the highest level of security and is legally binding. It is based on strict PKI standards and often requires secure hardware or software for generating the signature.
- **Use Cases**: Used for formal agreements, legal documents, and high-security transactions where legal enforceability is essential.
## Random Number Generation (RNG)

- **Definition**: A single number alone cannot be truly random; randomness is typically characterized by an infinite sequence of numbers. Randomness implies a lack of discernible order or predictability in a sequence.
- **Concept of Randomness**:
  - **Absence of Order**: True randomness signifies the absence of any systematic pattern or predictability. In practical terms, this means that the sequence of numbers does not follow any predictable trend or rule.
- **Application in Gambling**:
  - **Intelligent Gambling**: Even sophisticated gamblers cannot predict future outcomes based on past numbers. In a truly random sequence, each number or outcome is equally likely, and previous outcomes do not influence future ones. This uniform distribution of subsequences is a fundamental aspect of randomness, which is essential for various applications, including Monte Carlo simulations used for numerical integration.
### Importance of Random Number Generation
Random numbers are crucial in several fields, including cryptography, simulations, and statistical sampling. Here’s why:
- **Cryptography**: Secure encryption relies on unpredictable random numbers. If the randomness is compromised, the security of cryptographic systems can be undermined.
- **Simulations**: Random number generators (RNGs) are used in simulations, such as Monte Carlo methods, to model complex systems and processes by generating random inputs.
- **Statistical Sampling**: Random numbers are used to ensure unbiased sampling in surveys and experiments, providing a fair representation of a population.
### Types of Random Number Generators
#### True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)
- **Description**: TRNGs generate numbers based on physical processes or natural phenomena, such as radioactive decay or thermal noise. They produce sequences that are inherently random.
- **Advantages**: High level of unpredictability and true randomness.
- **Disadvantages**: Often slower and more complex to implement than pseudo-random generators.
#### Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs):
- **Description**: PRNGs use deterministic algorithms to produce sequences of numbers that appear random. They generate numbers based on an initial seed value.
- **Advantages**: Faster and more efficient than TRNGs; suitable for most applications requiring randomness.
- **Disadvantages**: The sequence is entirely predictable if the seed value is known, so they are not suitable for cryptographic purposes without additional safeguards.
### Key Properties of Random Sequences
- **Uniform Distribution**: Every number or outcome in the sequence should have an equal chance of occurring. This ensures that the sequence does not favor any particular outcome over others.
- **Independence**: Each number or outcome should be independent of the previous ones, meaning that past numbers do not affect future numbers.

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. 

It allows users to perform various operations on the data stored within a database, such as creating tables, retrieving data, updating records, and deleting data. SQL is fundamental to database management and is widely used in a broad range of applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise systems.
### Key Components of SQL
#### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL):
- **Purpose**: DDL is used to define and manage the database schema, which includes creating, altering, and deleting database objects like tables, indexes, and views.
- **Key Commands**:
  - **CREATE** - Used to create databases and their objects, such as tables, indexes, and views.
  - **ALTER** - Used to modify existing database objects, such as adding or deleting a column in a table.
  - **DROP** - Used to delete database objects, effectively removing them from the database.
#### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
- **Purpose**: DML is used for managing data within the schema objects, allowing users to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.
- **Key Commands**:
  - **SELECT** - Retrieves data from one or more tables in the database.
  - **INSERT** - Adds new data into a table.
  - **UPDATE** - Modifies existing data within a table.
  - **DELETE** - Removes data from a table.
#### 3. Data Control Language (DCL):
- **Purpose**: DCL is used to control access to the data within the database, managing permissions and security.
- **Key Commands**:
  - **GRANT** - Provides specific privileges to users, such as the ability to read, write, or modify data.
  - **REVOKE** - Removes previously granted privileges from users.
#### 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL):
- **Purpose**: TCL is used to manage transactions within the database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **Key Commands**:
  - **COMMIT** - Saves all the changes made in the current transaction to the database.
  - **ROLLBACK** - Undoes the changes made in the current transaction, reverting the database to its previous state.
  - **SAVEPOINT** - Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back, allowing partial rollbacks instead of undoing the entire transaction.

## What is a Data Store?

A **data store** is a repository where data is stored, managed, and made accessible for use. Data stores can range from simple systems, like file storage, to more complex systems, like relational databases. They play a crucial role in how data is organized, accessed, and processed in various applications and systems.
### Types of Data Stores
#### 1. Relational Databases
- **Description**: Store data in structured tables with rows and columns, making it easy to organize and query data using SQL.
- **Examples**:
  - **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and performance.
  - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system that supports advanced data types and performance optimization.
  - **Oracle Database**: A robust and scalable database widely used in enterprise environments for complex applications.
  - **Microsoft SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, commonly used in enterprise environments.
#### 2. NoSQL Databases
- **Description**: Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility and scalability for large-scale data operations.
- **Examples**:
  - **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
  - **Cassandra**: A highly scalable NoSQL database designed for distributed data across many servers without a single point of failure.
  - **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store, often used for caching and real-time data processing.
  - **CouchDB**: A NoSQL database that uses JSON to store data and JavaScript for query execution.
#### 3. In-Memory Databases
- **Description**: Store data in RAM rather than on disk, providing much faster access speeds, ideal for applications requiring real-time data processing.
- **Examples**:
  - **Redis**: Besides being a NoSQL database, Redis is also commonly used as an in-memory data store for fast access.
  - **Memcached**: A distributed memory caching system that speeds up dynamic web applications by reducing database load.
#### 4. File Systems
- **Description**: Store data as files on disk, organized in directories. File systems are the most basic form of data storage.
- **Examples**:
  - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A distributed file system designed for large-scale data storage and processing in a Hadoop cluster.
  - **Local File Systems**: Standard file storage on an individual computer or server, such as NTFS on Windows or ext4 on Linux.
#### 5. Cloud Storage
- **Description**: Managed storage services provided by cloud platforms, allowing for scalable, secure, and cost-effective data storage.
- **Examples**:
  - **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: A scalable object storage service used by developers to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
  - **Google Cloud Storage**: A cloud storage service that provides object storage with global edge-caching and content delivery.
  - **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage**: A service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

## Introduction to Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are security vulnerabilities where attackers insert or "inject" malicious code into a program, causing it to execute unintended commands. These attacks can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems, making them a significant threat to cybersecurity. Below are common types of injection attacks:

- **SQL Injection**: This occurs when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into an application to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Command Injection**: In this type, the attacker injects operating system commands into an application, causing the system to execute them.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Here, the attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing information or taking over sessions.
- **Code Injection**: This involves injecting arbitrary code that the application executes, often leading to unauthorized actions.
### Different Forms of SQL Injection Attacks
#### 1. Classic SQL Injection
- **Description**: The attacker injects SQL code into an input field (like a login form) to manipulate the query. For example, they might enter `' OR '1'='1` in a login form, which alters the SQL query to always return true, allowing them to bypass authentication.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**: `' OR '1'='1`
  - **SQL Query**: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password='{password_entered}'`
#### 2. Union-based SQL Injection
- **Description**: This attack uses the `UNION` operator to combine the result of the injected query with the original query, allowing the attacker to retrieve data from the database.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**: `' UNION SELECT 1,2,username,4,password FROM users WHERE '1'='1`
  - **SQL Query**: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' UNIO#### N SELECT 1,2,username,4,password FROM users WHERE '1'='#### 1'`
#### 3. Error-based SQL Injection
- Description: This type of SQL injection exploits error messages returned by the database to reveal information about the structure of the database.
- Example:
  - Input: `' OR 1=1 --`
  - SQL Query: `SELECT####  * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1 --`
#### 4. Blind SQL Injection
- Description: Blind SQL Injection is used when the application does not display error messages. Instead, the attacker relies on the application's behavior to infer information about the database.
- Example:
  - Input: `admin' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables) = 0 --`
  - SQL Query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM informat#### ion_schema.tables) = 0 --`
#### 5. Time-based SQL Injection
- Description: In this method, the attacker injects SQL code that causes a delay in the application's response, allowing them to infer information about the database.
- Example:
  - Input: `admin' AND (SELECT IF(SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin'),1,1)='a', SLEEP(5), 0))=0 --`
  - SQL Query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND (SELECT IF(SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin'),1,1)='a', SLEEP(5), 0))=0 --`
