## Setting up the Project and Introduction to Media Queries
- The session begins with setting up a new project in Visual Studio Code, creating an [[HTML]] file and a [[CSS]] file, and linking them together for the day's lesson. [(00:00:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=31s)
- The main topic of discussion is media queries, which are used to create responsive designs by applying different CSS rules based on screen size. [(00:01:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=74s)
- Media queries are explained as a way to apply specific CSS styles depending on whether the screen is large or small, allowing for adaptive design. [(00:02:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=158s)
- An example project is introduced, involving the creation of a profile layout with an image and text content, using HTML elements like image tags, divs, headings, and paragraphs. [(00:04:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=242s)
- The layout is designed to demonstrate the use of media queries, ensuring that content is displayed appropriately on different screen sizes. [(00:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=270s)
- The HTML structure is styled using CSS, starting with setting the font family of the body tag to system UI. [(00:05:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=343s)
- The profile section, which is the parent element, is given a width of 560 pixels and a margin of 40 pixels set to auto. [(00:05:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=354s)
- The display property is set to flex with a gap of 20 pixels, and the user class has a height of 120 pixels and a border radius of 12 pixels. [(00:06:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=375s)
- Adjustments are made to the image dimensions to make it square, initially set to 1000 by 1000 pixels, and later adjusted to 1600 pixels for better resolution. [(00:06:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=401s)
- The width of the image is further adjusted to 320 pixels, then to 220 pixels, and finally to 1300 pixels for optimal appearance. [(00:07:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=432s)
- The content, including the name and description, is styled, and a button with the class 'button' is added. The button has padding of 16 pixels by 30 pixels, a font size of 16 pixels, no border, a border radius of 12 pixels, a black background color, and white text color. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=490s)
- The heading and other content are adjusted, with the intro class having a margin-top of zero to align the content properly. [(00:09:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=563s)
- Additional adjustments are made to the width and spacing to ensure the content fits well, with a final width adjustment to 170 pixels. [(00:09:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=596s)
- A class is styled with a gray color and a smaller font size of 14 pixels to create a more elegant and faded appearance. [(00:10:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=614s)
- The goal is to make the design responsive, ensuring it looks good on both large and small screens. [(00:10:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=655s)
- The design initially appears responsive, but issues arise when the screen size changes, prompting the need for adjustments. [(00:11:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=693s)
- Media queries are introduced as a solution to handle responsiveness by defining minimum and maximum widths for applying specific [[CSS]] styles. [(00:11:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=719s)
- The concept of using media queries involves setting conditions based on screen size, such as applying different CSS for small and large screens. [(00:12:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=776s)
- The syntax for media queries includes specifying minimum and maximum widths, allowing for conditional styling based on screen dimensions. [(00:13:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=834s)
- An example is given where a minimum width of 600 pixels is set, changing the background color to red for larger screens, demonstrating how media queries work. [(00:14:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=842s)

## HTML Structure and CSS Styling of Profile Layout
- An example project is introduced, involving the creation of a profile layout with an image and text content, using [[HTML]] elements like image tags, divs, headings, and paragraphs. [(00:04:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=242s)
- The layout is designed to demonstrate the use of media queries, ensuring that content is displayed appropriately on different screen sizes. [(00:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=270s)
- The HTML structure is styled using [[CSS]], starting with setting the font family of the body tag to system UI. [(00:05:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=343s)

## Detailed CSS Styling and Adjustments
- The [[HTML]] structure is styled using [[CSS]], starting with setting the font family of the body tag to system UI. [(00:05:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=343s)
- The profile section, which is the parent element, is given a width of 560 pixels and a margin of 40 pixels set to auto. [(00:05:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=354s)
- The display property is set to flex with a gap of 20 pixels, and the user class has a height of 120 pixels and a border radius of 12 pixels. [(00:06:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=375s)
- Adjustments are made to the image dimensions to make it square, initially set to 1000 by 1000 pixels, and later adjusted to 1600 pixels for better resolution. [(00:06:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=401s)
- The width of the image is further adjusted to 320 pixels, then to 220 pixels, and finally to 1300 pixels for optimal appearance. [(00:07:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=432s)
- The content, including the name and description, is styled, and a button with the class 'button' is added. The button has padding of 16 pixels by 30 pixels, a font size of 16 pixels, no border, a border radius of 12 pixels, a black background color, and white text color. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=490s)
- The heading and other content are adjusted, with the intro class having a margin-top of zero to align the content properly. [(00:09:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=563s)
- Additional adjustments are made to the width and spacing to ensure the content fits well, with a final width adjustment to 170 pixels. [(00:09:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=596s)

## Introduction to Media Queries for Responsiveness
- The design initially appears responsive, but issues arise when the screen size changes, prompting the need for adjustments. [(00:11:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=693s)
- Media queries are introduced as a solution to handle responsiveness by defining minimum and maximum widths for applying specific [[CSS]] styles. [(00:11:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=719s)
- The concept of using media queries involves setting conditions based on screen size, such as applying different CSS for small and large screens. [(00:12:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=776s)
- The syntax for media queries includes specifying minimum and maximum widths, allowing for conditional styling based on screen dimensions. [(00:13:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=834s)
- An example is given where a minimum width of 600 pixels is set, changing the background color to red for larger screens, demonstrating how media queries work. [(00:14:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=842s)
- A minimum width of 600 pixels is set, meaning that the minimum criteria for applying a specific style, such as a red color, is a width of 600 pixels or more. [(00:14:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=882s)
- The concept of minimum and maximum width is explained using an analogy of discounts, where a minimum discount is guaranteed, but the maximum can vary. Similarly, a minimum width ensures a style is applied, while the maximum width can be any value. [(00:15:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=900s)
- For small screens, a maximum width is set, meaning styles are applied up to a certain width, similar to setting an upper cap on discounts. If the screen width is 600 pixels or less, a different style, such as a blue color, is applied. [(00:15:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=959s)
- When the screen width is exactly 600 pixels, the style defined for smaller screens (blue color) is applied, as it is positioned at the bottom of the [[CSS]] rules. [(00:17:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1054s)
- To make the design responsive, CSS for big screens is separated from that for small screens. The CSS for big screens is applied when the minimum width is met, while for small screens, unnecessary styles are removed, and elements are centered using text alignment. [(00:18:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1091s)

## Advanced Styling Techniques and Image Optimization
- The width and height of an image can be set to 120 pixels each, and a border radius of 50% can be applied to create a circular image. However, this can impact the image resolution if the original aspect ratio is different. [(00:19:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1155s)
- The object-fit: cover property can be used to maintain the image resolution by fitting the image within the specified size. [(00:20:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1206s)
- Buttons can be styled with padding and border radius, and their appearance can be adjusted for different screen sizes. [(00:20:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1233s)
- The flex-wrap property is useful for arranging multiple elements side by side and shifting them to the next line if space is limited, but it cannot change the shape of images. [(00:21:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1265s)
- Media queries are necessary to customize [[CSS]] for different screen sizes, allowing changes such as button color adjustments on small screens. [(00:21:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1312s)
- Breakpoints can be chosen based on specific needs or industry standards, with 600 pixels being a suitable breakpoint for certain requirements. Standard breakpoints include 586 pixels for small screens and around 992 pixels for laptop screens. [(00:22:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1369s)

## Breakpoints and Responsiveness
- Breakpoints can be chosen based on specific needs or industry standards, with 600 pixels being a suitable breakpoint for certain requirements. Standard breakpoints include 586 pixels for small screens and around 992 pixels for laptop screens. [(00:22:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1369s)
- For large screens, a width of 1,200 pixels or more is recommended, but users can choose their own numbers based on specific needs. This approach can be applied to make any design responsive. [(00:23:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1428s)

## Project Overview and Introduction to Animations
- A major project will be developed that includes a fully responsive social media website, incorporating all the concepts learned, including animations. [(00:24:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1457s)
- Animations can be created quickly, in less than a minute, and the process will be demonstrated. [(00:24:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1497s)
- Progress in learning is attributed to structured guidance and practice, which simplifies complex tasks like writing media queries for different screen sizes. [(00:25:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1537s)
- The complexity of writing media queries for multiple screens depends on the level of practice and the specific use case. [(00:26:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1562s)
- Before starting animations, a design element will be prepared on the screen to animate, and a timer will be used to demonstrate the speed of creating animations. [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1614s)
- A design example includes a class called "card image" with dimensions of 1600 by 1000 pixels, a heading, and a paragraph with a class called "description." [(00:27:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1638s)
- The [[CSS]] styling for the design will be discussed, with a focus on animations in the next 15 minutes. [(00:28:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1680s)
- The margin is set to 20 pixels and auto, with a border of 1 pixel solid light green and a border radius of 14 pixels. [(00:28:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1704s)
- When the mouse hovers over a food item, it should animate by rotating 180 degrees using the hover effect. [(00:30:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1805s)
- To achieve animation, a transition of 1 second is applied to the card element, allowing it to animate smoothly when hovered over. [(00:31:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1865s)
- A zoom effect can be created by adjusting the width to 310 pixels on hover, resulting in a zoom animation. [(00:32:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1920s)
- The speed of the animation can be increased by decreasing the transition time, for example, setting it to 3 seconds for a faster effect. [(00:32:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1949s)
- Multiple [[CSS]] properties can be used within the hover effect, such as setting the border to 1 pixel solid white. [(00:32:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1971s)
- A shadow effect is applied with specific pixel values, and adjustments are made to demonstrate a zoom animation when the mouse hovers over an element. [(00:33:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=1984s)
- The ease of creating animations with CSS is highlighted, emphasizing that no complex techniques are required. [(00:34:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2040s)
- A tilt animation effect is also demonstrated, showing how CSS properties can be combined creatively. [(00:34:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2061s)
- The importance of understanding CSS properties to enhance creativity in web development is discussed. [(00:34:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2084s)

## Advanced Animation Concepts and Keyframes
- The desire to animate elements without mouse interaction is expressed, leading to the introduction of advanced animation concepts. [(00:37:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2231s)
- Animation involves moving any text, image, video, or object on the screen. [(00:37:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2249s)
- A demonstration is provided using a [[CSS]] class with a box of 100x100 pixels, a background color, and a top margin of 40 pixels. [(00:37:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2273s)
- An analogy is used to explain animation concepts, involving a cricket player running between two wickets, which represents the movement in an animation. [(00:38:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2335s)
- Three key components of creating animations are highlighted: the name of the object (e.g., the player running), the duration of the animation, and the destination or endpoint of the animation. [(00:39:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2368s)
- The process of defining an animation involves specifying the animation name, duration, and using keyframes to define the destination or path of the animation. [(00:40:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2449s)
- Keyframes are used to define the destination or the path of the animation, similar to how a cricket player runs from one wicket to another. [(00:41:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2495s)
- A scenario is described where two players need to reach different destinations, emphasizing the importance of clearly defining each player's destination to avoid confusion. Key frames are used to define the destination for a player named XYZ, specifying the starting point and the end goal. [(00:42:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2543s)
- The process of creating animations in [[CSS]] is explained, including defining the animation name, duration, and key frames. The animation involves moving an object from a starting point to an end point. [(00:43:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2620s)
- An example is given where a box is animated to rotate 360 degrees and move using CSS properties like transform and margin-left. The animation is set to not return to its original position using animation-fill-mode: forwards. [(00:44:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2660s)
- The animation is initially set to run once, but it can be configured to run multiple times using animation-iteration-count, which can be set to a specific number or to infinite for continuous animation. [(00:45:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2751s)
- The simplicity of creating animations is highlighted, focusing on three main components: name, duration, and destination. The speed of the animation can be adjusted, and an analogy is made with a player running faster when a ball is approaching. [(00:46:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2784s)
- Running animations more quickly reduces the time taken, which in turn increases the speed of the animation. This can be achieved by setting the animation duration to a shorter time, such as 1 second. [(00:46:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2812s)
- Animations can be reversed by setting the animation direction to "reverse," allowing the animation to run from the end point back to the start point. [(00:47:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2851s)
- To animate in both directions, from start to end and back, the "alternate" value can be used for the animation direction, enabling smooth transitions between the two points. [(00:48:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2881s)
- [[CSS animations]] can be customized by changing properties such as background color, border radius, height, and width, allowing for transformations like converting a box to a circle or altering the size of elements. [(00:48:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=2914s)

## CSS Animations: Practical Applications and Limitations
- While [[CSS]] animations are being learned for fun, they are not commonly used in practical applications like [[Airbnb]] or [[YouTube]], where animations are minimal. Instead, specialized libraries like GSAP are often used for more complex animations. [(00:50:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3001s)
- Creating animations and shiny features on a website often only constitutes a small portion of the overall project, typically around 5% of the website's content. [(00:51:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3062s)
- Beginners may become overly focused on creating complex animations, spending months on them, only to realize later that these elements were not crucial to the website's functionality. [(00:51:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3072s)
- It is important for beginners to understand the limitations and prioritize what is initially important in web development, rather than getting lost in endless permutations of animations. [(00:52:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3149s)
- Having a mentor can be beneficial in guiding beginners to focus on the right aspects of web development, as opposed to relying solely on online courses and tutorials. [(00:52:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3159s)
- Many people accumulate numerous online resources, such as [[Udemy]] courses and YouTube playlists, but these may not always provide the practical help needed to become a front-end or full-stack developer. [(00:52:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3166s)
- The typical roadmap for becoming a developer includes learning [[HTML]], [[CSS]], JavaScript, a framework like [[Tailwind CSS | Tailwind]] or [[Bootstrap (front-end framework) | Bootstrap]], a library like [[React (JavaScript library) | React]], [[Vue.js | Vue]], or [[Angular (web framework) | Angular]], and then moving on to backend technologies, databases, and [[API | APIs]]. [(00:53:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3209s)
- While it is possible to learn web development independently, it can be time-consuming and frustrating without guidance, similar to traveling without a map or vehicle. [(00:54:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3255s)
- Having a mentor can make the learning process more efficient and less stressful, providing direction and support similar to having a convenient mode of transportation for a journey. [(00:54:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MpbaEFixoc&t=3288s)
