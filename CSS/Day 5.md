## Session Start and Welcome
- The session begins with a check to ensure everyone can hear and see properly, and participants are asked to type "LC loud and clear" in the chat box if they can [(00:00:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=5s).
- The host welcomes everyone to the last day of the boot camp and thanks them for joining, also thanking specific individuals such as HP, Sakshi, Godav, and Prabhat [(00:00:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=28s).
- [[Naveen John]] mentions that he is not planning to join the course, and the host clarifies that the session will not be solving the course for one hour but rather combining what has been learned so far [(00:00:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=56s).
- The host asks participants to type "LC loud and clear" in the chat box again to confirm they can hear and see properly, and explains that the session will combine everything learned so far to make something responsive [(00:01:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=88s).

## Course Overview and Onboarding

- A participant asks about updates on the Full Stack course, and the host mentions that it is not possible to cover everything in just five days [(00:02:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=138s).
- The host explains that the session will combine what has been learned from day one, including the Box model, flexbox, and animations, to make a complete and responsive project [(00:02:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=175s).
- The host asks participants to type "excited" in the chat box if they are excited for the session, and mentions that media queries have already been covered [(00:03:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=195s).

## Project Setup and Clarifications
- The host shares their screen and asks participants to start their videos so they can be seen live, and asks participants to type "V" for "visible" in the chat box if they can see the screen [(00:03:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=211s).
- A new project folder will be created in VS Code, and inside this folder, two files will be created: index.html and style.[[CSS | css]], which are the basic files for HTML and CSS coding [(00:04:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=277s).
- The focus of the session is to understand and clarify thoughts, and the source code will be shared so that it can be practiced [(00:05:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=347s).

## Post-Session Information
- The recordings, source code, and certificates will be available by 10 or 11 pm, and all queries will be answered [(00:06:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=369s).
- A completely responsive [[Social media | social media website]] will be created in the session, which will be built in 30-40 minutes [(00:06:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=410s).
- The importance of having a clear layout and wireframe in mind before starting to code is emphasized, whether it's a major project or a small one [(00:07:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=471s).
- A social media website will be created, which will consist of posts and a store section for shared stories, and the layout will be designed accordingly [(00:08:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=507s).
- The session will cover all the concepts learned in the last five days, and the goal is to create a responsive design in a short amount of time [(00:07:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=438s).

## Webpage Structure and Basic Styling
- A basic structure for a webpage can be divided into three main chunks: the nav bar, the story segment, and the main segment or container, with the main segment further divided into two halves, the main part or post part and the sidebar or content bar [(00:09:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=544s).
- The structure can be created using a container class, with initial styles including a width of 990 pixels, a margin of 50 pixels and auto, a height of 100 VH, and a background color of blue violet [(00:09:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=596s).
- The height of 100 VH refers to the viewport height, which is the height of the screen, with 0 meaning no height and 100 meaning the complete height [(00:10:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=646s).
- VH stands for viewport height and VW stands for viewport width, which are used to refer to the height and width of the screen, respectively [(00:11:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=707s).
- The values VH and VW are used because the screen size cannot be predicted, and they allow for flexible and responsive design [(00:11:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=675s).
- Two classes, feeds and sidebar, will be created inside the container to categorize the main post and sidebar segments [(00:12:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=778s).
- The feeds class will be used for the main post, which will contain multiple posts from users [(00:13:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=780s).
- The purpose of using VH and VW in this example is for demonstration purposes, and these styles will be removed later [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=758s).

## Main Segment Styling
- A [[CSS]] class named "feed" is created to style the main segment or post segment of the webpage, which will contain the content shared by users [(00:15:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=950s).
- The "feed" class is designed to have a border of 1 pixel, solid, and light gray in color, along with a padding of 8 pixels and a border radius of 14 pixels [(00:17:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1057s).
- Inside the "feed" class, a class named "feed-image" is created to style the images posted by users, which will have a source URL from [[Unsplash]] and a caption [(00:16:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1002s).
- The layout of the webpage is designed using Flexbox, with the container having a display property set to "Flex" to arrange the main segment and sidebar side by side [(00:15:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=906s).
- The main segment has a width of 590 pixels, and the sidebar has a width of 400 pixels, making the total width 990 pixels [(00:14:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=869s).
- The background color of the main segment is set to orange, and the background color of the sidebar is set to royal blue [(00:14:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=879s).
- The height of the main segment is set to 100 VH (viewport height) [(00:13:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=825s).
- The importance of understanding layouts in [[CSS]] is emphasized, and it is suggested that beginners should start by creating a basic layout before adding more styles [(00:15:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=918s).

## Profile and Post Styling
- A "profile" class is created to hold the profile image, name, and username of the person who made the post [(00:18:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1104s).
- The profile image is added with a size of 300 by 300 pixels and a class called "user" [(00:19:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1153s).
- The "profile" class is designed with display set to flex, a gap of 7 pixels, and the user image height and width set to 40 pixels with a border radius of 50% [(00:19:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1182s).
- The name and username are styled with zero margin, and the username is given a grayish color and a font size of 14 pixels [(00:20:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1214s).
- The profile is given a margin bottom of 24 pixels and the text is aligned center using the align items property [(00:20:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1254s).
- Align items is used for vertical alignment, and it is used to align the text in the profile [(00:21:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1313s).
- Icons to interact with the post are obtained from [[Bootstrap (front-end framework) | Get Bootstrap]], which offers various icon options such as Hero Icons, Great Icons, and [[Font Awesome]] [(00:22:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1327s).

## Adding Icons and Dummy Data
- The process of selecting icons for a [[Social media | social media]] app's post features, such as liking, commenting, sharing, and saving, is initiated, with the goal of finding suitable icons for these actions [(00:22:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1355s).
- The heart icon is selected and copied from an [[SVG]], then added to the HTML with a class called "icons" and a size of 24x24 pixels [(00:22:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1370s).
- Additional icons are searched for, including a chat icon, a share/send icon, and a bookmark icon, which are then copied and added to the HTML with the same size [(00:23:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1403s).
- The icons are styled using [[CSS]], with the parent element "icons" set to display as Flex, allowing for the use of other Flex properties such as justify-content and space-between [(00:25:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1517s).
- Dummy data is generated to create multiple posts, and the feed is copied to create multiple instances of the post template [(00:25:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1545s).
- The posts are styled to have a margin bottom of 24-28 pixels to add space between them [(00:26:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1598s).
- The process of adding random data to the posts is initiated, starting from the top post [(00:26:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1616s).
- Multiple images with different names and descriptions are being added, including an image of a boy named Albert with an image of an airport, an image of a woman named Bhavna with an image of cooking, an image of a coder named Navneet with an image of a train or mountains, and an image of a person named Arun with an image of running [(00:27:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1623s).
- The dimensions of the images are being changed to show dynamicness, as people may capture photos in different ratios [(00:27:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1679s).
- Another image of a girl named Kavya with an image of flowers is added, along with a name and a number [(00:30:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1810s).

## Navigation Bar Creation
- A navigation bar is being added, which will include a logo and a button to create a post [(00:30:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1839s).
- The navigation bar will have a class called "navbar" and will include an image with a class called "logo" [(00:31:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1860s).
- A button with a class called "button" will be added to the navigation bar, which will say "create post" [(00:31:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1881s).
- The design of the navigation bar will include a width of 990 pixels, a margin of 20 pixels, and some padding [(00:31:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1901s).
- A logo for [[Instagram]] is needed, and it's recommended to get an [[SVG]] version for better quality, which can be found by searching for "Instagram logo text" and saving the image as "logo.svg" on the desktop in a folder named "three to five series bootcamp on day five" [(00:32:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1930s).
- The logo is added to the project, but it's too big, so a logo class is used to adjust its height to 20 pixels, and later increased to 60 pixels, but it's still not the right size [(00:33:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=1990s).
- A new logo is found and saved as "insta-logo" and used in the project, which is bigger and better suited for the design [(00:33:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2032s).
- The logo size is adjusted to 36 pixels, which is considered sufficient, and the navbar is designed to have a display of flex, justify content space between, and align items center [(00:34:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2054s).
- A create post button is added to the right-hand side of the navbar, and its styles are defined, including background color, border, border radius, padding, and font size [(00:34:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2061s).
- The button styles are completed, and the navbar is checked to ensure everything is aligned properly, but it's noticed that the logo is slightly on top and needs adjustment [(00:35:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2118s).
- The logo's position is adjusted by changing its height to 34 pixels, and the design is tweaked to ensure everything is aligned correctly [(00:36:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2219s).
- The margin top in the logo is adjusted to four pixels for a tweak, making it look more perfect [(00:37:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2241s).

## Story Segment Creation
- The next step is to add stories that users have posted, and it would be cool if videos can be turned on [(00:37:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2256s).
- A segment for the story is created, and an image is added inside the story container with a class called "story" [(00:38:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2281s).
- The story container has a width of 990 pixels, a margin of 20 pixels and auto, a display of flex, and a gap of eight pixels [(00:38:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2316s).
- The story has a height of 80 pixels and a border radius of 50 pixels [(00:39:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2349s).
- Multiple stories are created by copying and pasting the story container, and the names of the users are changed to woman, student, cat, man, boy, girl, coder, doctor, lion, and tree [(00:39:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2365s).
- The names of the users are displayed at the bottom of the stories by wrapping the image inside a div with a class called "user story" and adding a paragraph with a class called "user name" [(00:41:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2483s).
- The user name is displayed below the image, and this is done for all the stories [(00:41:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2510s).
- A list of names is being added to an Instagram-like interface, including [[Alps | Alpit]], [[Manchu people | Manchu]], Kunal, Kavya, Aman, Saurabh, Navneet, and Deepali, along with a story name for each [(00:42:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2534s).
- The names are being styled to have a uniform appearance, with adjustments made to the text alignment, margin, and font size [(00:42:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2577s).

## Responsiveness and Sidebar Addition
- The current design is not responsive, and there are plans to make it responsive and add a sidebar, which is expected to take around 10-12 minutes [(00:46:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2779s).
- The design is being tested on a small screen, revealing issues such as a hidden button and incomplete display of stories [(00:46:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2802s).
- The goal is to make the design responsive and fix the issues, with a possible solution involving the use of external font styles imported from [[Google Fonts]] [(00:47:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2829s).
- The design is being fine-tuned, with adjustments made to the margin and font size to improve its appearance [(00:45:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2728s).
- The design is being reviewed, with viewers asked to provide feedback by typing "LG" in the chat box if it looks good [(00:46:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2765s).
- A sidebar is being added with a heading that says "Explore the best experience of [[Instagram]] in Mobile" and a description in 16 words, along with buttons to download the app from the Instagram, Apple Store, and [[Google Play | Play Store]] [(00:47:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2838s).
- Two images are being used for the buttons, one for the [[Google | Google Play Store]] and the other for the [[App store | App Store]] [(00:48:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2901s).
- A div called "app" is created to contain the images, and the images are styled to display side by side with a height of 40 pixels and a gap of 8 pixels [(00:48:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2916s).
- A gap of 40 pixels is added between the sidebar and the container to provide sufficient space [(00:49:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=2989s).
- A class called "Mt 0" is created to remove the margin top, and it is applied to the heading tag to remove the space on top [(00:50:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3006s).
- The layout is checked on bigger screen sizes, and it is confirmed that it looks good, with plans to make it responsive for small screen sizes as well [(00:50:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3023s).

## Implementing Media Queries for Responsiveness
- The next step is to make the layout responsive using media queries, starting with the small screen size [(00:51:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3070s).
- A media query is written in the [[CSS]] to target big screens with a minimum width of 990 pixels [(00:51:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3106s).
- The goal is to make the content responsive for mobile screens when the screen size is less than 990 pixels [(00:51:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3116s).
- To achieve this, a media query is used to target screen sizes with a maximum width of 990 pixels [(00:52:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3138s).
- The existing code is copied and pasted into the media query to apply the styles to small screens [(00:52:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3160s).
- The navigation bar is made responsive by removing its width and making its content flexible [(00:53:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3200s).
- The story container is also made responsive by removing its width and setting its width to 100vw, and then hiding any overflowing content [(00:53:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3239s).
- However, the story container's width is later changed to 100% to make it work better, and the overflow is set to scroll to allow scrolling behind the stories [(00:54:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3298s).
- The post container is also adjusted to make it responsive by removing its width, display, and gap, and removing the width of the feeds [(00:55:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3352s).
- Adjustments were made to the sizes of elements in the story segment, including changing the margin top to 60 pixels and the container size to 20 pixels, to improve the layout on small screen sizes [(00:56:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3385s).
- The values used for styling are not memorized, but rather determined based on the current design and may change in the future [(00:57:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3461s).
- The layout was centered by removing the width and setting the text align to center in the sidebar, and by setting the justify content to center in the app class [(00:58:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3499s).
- The design is now totally responsive and can be checked on different screen sizes [(00:59:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkEg9tkcR4&t=3545s).
