### Definitions

1. **SciPy**: SciPy is a Python library that provides tools and functions for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and offers modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, linear algebra, statistics, and more.

2. **Numerical Integration**: Numerical integration is a method used to calculate the area under a curve or the total sum of small, calculated parts of a function. It's like adding up tiny pieces to get an approximate value of a whole.

3. **Linear Algebra**: Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. It's used in many areas, like solving equations, computer graphics, and data science.

4. **Optimization**: Optimization is the process of finding the best solution or the maximum or minimum value of a function. It’s used to make things more efficient, such as minimizing costs or maximizing profits.

5. **Fourier Transform**: A Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that breaks down a signal (like a sound or image) into its individual frequencies. It's used in signal processing, like filtering noise out of audio.

6. **Interpolation**: Interpolation is a method used to estimate unknown values between two known values. It’s like connecting the dots on a graph to fill in the gaps.

7. **Statistical Testing**: Statistical testing is a method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It helps determine if an observed effect is statistically significant or just due to random chance.

  - Example:
    ```python
    from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
    import numpy as np

    # Given data points
    x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    y = np.array([0, 1, 4, 9])

    # Create the interpolation function
