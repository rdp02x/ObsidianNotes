### 1. Explain in Detail About Control Flow Structures in Python
Control flow structures in Python determine the order in which statements are executed. They allow you to execute certain code blocks conditionally, repeatedly, or based on specific conditions. The main control flow structures include:
- **Conditional Statements:** These include `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements that execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
- **Loops:** These include `for` and `while` loops, which repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Control Flow Statements:** These include `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements that control the execution flow inside loops or conditional statements.

### 2. Illustrate the Different Types of Control Flow Statements Available in Python with Flowcharts
- **If-Else Statement:** Executes a block of code if a condition is true; otherwise, it executes another block.
    ```
    [Start] -> [Condition] -> (True) -> [Execute Block A] -> [End]
                             -> (False) -> [Execute Block B] -> [End]
    ```

- **For Loop:** Repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence.
    ```
    [Start] -> [Initialize] -> [Check Condition] -> (True) -> [Execute Block] -> [Update] -> [Check Condition]
                                      -> (False) -> [End]
    ```

- **While Loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    ```
    [Start] -> [Check Condition] -> (True) -> [Execute Block] -> [Check Condition]
                                      -> (False) -> [End]
    ```

### 3. Explain the Need for `continue` and `break` Statements
- **`break` Statement:** Used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. It’s useful when you want to stop the loop entirely based on some condition.
- **`continue` Statement:** Skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. It’s useful when you want to skip certain parts of the loop based on a condition without exiting the loop.

### 4. Explain the Syntax of the Following Statements
- **For Loop:**
  ```python
  for variable in sequence:
      # Code block to execute
  ```

- **While Loop:**
  ```python
  while condition:
      # Code block to execute
  ```

- **If-Else:**
  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code block to execute if condition is true
  else:
      # Code block to execute if condition is false
  ```

- **If-Elif-Else:**
  ```python
  if condition1:
      # Code block to execute if condition1 is true
  elif condition2:
      # Code block to execute if condition2 is true
  else:
      # Code block to execute if none of the above conditions are true
  ```

### 5. Write a Program to Check Whether a Number is Odd or Even
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even.")
else:
    print("Odd.")
```

### 6. Write a Program to Check Whether a Number is Largest
```python
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a >= b and a >= c:
    print("a is largest")
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print("b is largest")
else:
    print("c is largest")
```

### 7. Write a Program to Print the Following Pattern
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, end=" ")
    print()
```

### 8. Define `break` Statement, `continue` Statement, `pass` Statement with Their Syntax
- **break Statement:** Exits the loop.
  **Syntax:** `break`.
- **continue Statement:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
  **Syntax:** `continue`.
- **pass Statement:** Does nothing; it’s a placeholder for code that you want to implement later.
  **Syntax:** `pass`.
### 9. Explain Boolean Value and Boolean Expression
- **Boolean Value:** It represents one of two possible states: `True` or `False`.
- **Boolean Expression:** It is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Example: `5 > 3` returns `True`.

### 10. Explain Switch Statement with Their Functions
Python does not have a native `switch` statement like some other languages. However, similar functionality can be achieved using dictionaries or `if-elif-else` statements.
- **Example using Dictionary:**
  ```python
  def switch_demo(argument):
      switcher = {
          1: "January",
          2: "February",
          3: "March",
          # Add more cases here
      }
      return switcher.get(argument, "Invalid month")
  ```
